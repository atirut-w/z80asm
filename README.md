# Z80ASM
An attempt at making a Z80 assembler that outputs to ELF format. WIP.

## Build dependencies
- *A* C++ compiler
- CMake
- Boost

If you're on Windows, good luck installing the dependencies. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) *may* save you from hell. If you're on Linux, be sure to pick the devel version of the required libraries.
